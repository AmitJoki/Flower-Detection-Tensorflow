# Flower-Detection-Tensorflow

I found it hard to find an equivalent of the "Hello, World!" program of the conventional languages in the area of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. A "Hello, World!" program lets you run the program, edit it instantly and try things out.

Flower-Detection-Tensorflow uses Tensorflow 2.0 for image processing and prediction and uses Flask as the medium to consume the trained model.

## Prerequisites

1. Download the dataset from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz) and extract the photos to the `Images` folder.
2. Install Tensorflow 2.0, Tensorflow Hub
3. Install Flask
4. Install matplotlib
5. Install numpy.

## Execution

```
$ cd Flower-Detection TensorFlow
$ flask run
```
